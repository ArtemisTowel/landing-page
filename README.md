# landing-page

The purpose of this project is to display a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. The flex alignment assignments were pretty challenging but upon completion of this project I realize that I really enjoy this type of work. The mix of creativity, logical reasoning, and experimenting was extremely satisfying while creating my first landing page. I hope to continue growing my interest in web design with JS.
